In Chinese culture, this regal being is a representation of the first God. \n\nIn one Chinese creation myth, the Jade Emperor fashioned the first humans from clay and left them to harden in the sun. Rain deformed some of the figures, which gave rise to human sickness. At this point, it was too late to invent umbrellas.",
